### Reading Returners - A React Project Application

#### The Application

As part of your ongoing development we'd like you to create a React application, the details of which are below.

Please create a react app called Reading Returners. The purpose of the app is to allow a person to search for books and build their own personal reading list. The app should allow for the following:

Search for books by title
Add a book to your personal reading list
Ability to remove a book from your own personal reading list
Mark a book as having been read and leave a review

You should ensure that the following things are included:

React state
Utilisation of props
Event handling
README instructions for starting the application locally
The UI and UX of the application is entirely up to you
Connection to a backend API that provides functions for searching and managing your own personal reading list as per above
A MySQL database storing the required data
Backend and Frontend GitHub repositories

NOTE: For the searching functionality we recommend utilising the Google Books API

https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview
https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-books-search

#### Bonus points

The following items are not required but will be interesting for us to review if you have time to complete:

An ability to log into your application using Auth0
A click to tweet button that shares your review of the given book
Deployment to a live site

#### Submitting your work

Please submit your work by sharing the GitHub links to any of the associated repositories
